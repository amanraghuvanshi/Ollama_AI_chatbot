# Architecture Overview

## Project Overview

This project implements a locally hosted AI chatbot using the `deepseek-r1:1.5b` model via Ollama. It provides a modular design with a backend for managing model interactions and a frontend built using Streamlit or Gradio for user interaction. The project is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

## System Components

### 1. **Backend**

* **Role:** Manages interactions with the AI model and handles preprocessing of user inputs.
* **Technologies:** Python, Ollama CLI
* **Key Modules:**

  * **`app.py`:** Serves as the main entry point for backend logic.
  * **`ollama_handler.py`:** Interfaces with the Ollama `deepseek-r1:1.5b` model using subprocess calls.
  * **`preprocess.py`:** (Optional) Handles data preprocessing, e.g., cleaning input text.
  * **`config.py`:** Stores configuration settings such as file paths, API keys, and model parameters.

---

### 2. **Frontend**

* **Role:** Provides an interactive user interface to communicate with the backend.
* **Technologies:** Python, Streamlit/Gradio
* **Options:**

  * **Streamlit:** A dashboard-like application for input and output visualization.
  * **Gradio:** A lightweight, customizable interface for testing and deployment.
* **Key Features:**

  * Accepts user input (text queries).
  * Displays the AI model’s responses in real-time.
  * Modular components for ease of customization.

---

### 3. **Model**

* **Role:** Processes queries using the `deepseek-r1:1.5b` model.
* **Technologies:** Ollama CLI
* **Details:**

  * Preloaded locally to ensure privacy and offline functionality.
  * Accessed via CLI commands.

---

### 4. **Testing**

* **Role:** Ensures robustness and correctness of the application.
* **Tools:** Python's `unittest` or `pytest`
* **Scope:**

  * Backend module tests for Ollama interaction.
  * Frontend tests for user interface consistency.
  * Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.

---

### 5. **Data**

* **Role:** Organizes raw and processed data used by the application.
* **Structure:**

  * `data/raw/` for unprocessed data.
  * `data/processed/` for cleaned and prepared datasets.

---

### 6. **Documentation**

* **Role:** Guides users and developers on system use and maintenance.
* **Includes:**

  * `architecture.md`: Overview of the system architecture.
  * `api_docs.md`: API documentation for backend endpoints.
  * `user_manual.md`: End-user instructions.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity:**

   * Independent components for backend, frontend, and model interactions.
   * Simplifies maintenance and testing.

2. **Local Privacy:**

   * AI model runs entirely locally, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency.

3. **Scalability:**

   * Flexible frontend options (Streamlit or Gradio) to accommodate diverse use cases.
   * Potential for future integration with additional services.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add support for multi-model interaction.
* Enhance frontend with advanced visualization tools.
* Implement caching for faster responses.
